# Projects

Although not an Intecture component themselves, _Projects_ are complex enough that they deserve their own reference section.

Most of what projects are and do is in the [Anatomy of a Project](ch03-anatomy.html) chapter. The information here should fill in the details that were glossed over.

## Bootstrap files

Each project must have a bootstrap file, as does each payload. The bootstrap file must be called `main`, with the appropriate extension, and live at the root of the `src/` directory:

- C - `src/main.c`
- PHP - `src/main.php`
- Rust - `src/main.rs`
